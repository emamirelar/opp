## Resolved QA Issues

| QA ID | Title | Resolution | Date Resolved | Resolved By |
|-------|-------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| QA-001 | Playwright tests using incorrect route format | Updated route paths in `contacts.spec.ts` from `/contacts` to `/#/partnerships/contacts` to match Angular hash-based routing. Need to audit other test files. | 2026-01-26 | QA Team |
| QA-002 | Welcome tour dialog blocks initial Playwright test navigation | Enhanced `loginAndNavigate()` helper with retry logic, initial wait, and dialog dismissal verification. Dialog now consistently dismissed before navigation. | 2026-01-26 | QA Team |
| QA-003 | Webkit browser tests experiencing severe navigation timeouts | **All 4 Priority Fixes Implemented:**<br/>1. Increased webkit timeouts (nav: 120s, action: 60s, test: 180s)<br/>2. Webkit-specific navigation strategy (`domcontentloaded` + stabilization)<br/>3. Added `waitForAngularReady()` function for webkit<br/>4. Optimized API mock setup timing<br/><br/>**Results:** Navigation timeouts eliminated, webkit pass rate improved from 15% (2/13) to 75% (6/8). Remaining failures due to DEF-001 (route guard), not webkit-specific. | 2026-01-26 | QA Team |
| QA-004 | Integration test data seeding - entities missing required Name property | **All Fixes Implemented:**<br/>1. Created Contact test data infrastructure (faker, seeder methods, validation tests)<br/>2. Fixed 3 Contact instances and 4 Interaction instances in test files<br/>3. Added test-environment detection to Startup.cs Google Credential registration<br/>4. Implemented .NET 9 PipeWriter workaround in GlobalExceptionHandler<br/><br/>**Results:** Fixed 1 integration test (57→56 failures). Created reusable test infrastructure with 5 validation tests (all passing). | 2026-01-27 | QA Team |
| QA-005 | .NET 9 PipeWriter serialization bug in integration tests | Implemented try-catch workaround in `GlobalExceptionHandler.TryHandleAsync()` to catch PipeWriter InvalidOperationException and use fallback serialization method (`WriteAsync()` instead of `WriteAsJsonAsync()`). Tests can now receive proper error responses instead of secondary crashes. GitHub issue #108075 tracked at Microsoft. | 2026-01-27 | QA Team |
| QA-006 | Marathon test files missing using statement and duplicate method names | **All Cleanup Completed:**<br/>1. Added `using UNOPS.PAO.IntegrationTests.Infrastructure;` to 69 integration test files<br/>2. Renamed 6 duplicate test methods to unique names across 4 test files<br/>3. Fixed `PartnerTreeValidationTests.cs` missing `using UNOPS.PAO.Models.PartnerTrees;`<br/><br/>**Files Fixed:** 69 test files updated with using statements, 6 methods renamed (DSTNegativeTests, OrgHierarchyNegativeTests, PartnerTreeNegativeTests, RoleNegativeTests)<br/><br/>**Results:** 0 syntax errors, all 3,820 tests now compile successfully (runtime failures expected due to missing managers - see DEF-005 Phase 2). Test infrastructure cleanup complete, unblocks 1,800 tests for execution once managers are created. | 2026-01-28 | QA Team |

## Test Infrastructure Inventory

### Playwright Test Status (as of 2026-01-26 - After QA-003 Resolution)

**Test Suites:**
- `contacts.spec.ts` - 39 tests across 3 browsers
  - ✅ Route navigation fixed (QA-001)
  - ✅ Welcome dialog handling fixed (QA-002)
  - ✅ Webkit navigation timeouts fixed (QA-003)
  - ❌ Remaining failures due to DEF-001 (route permission guard - developer defect)

**Browser-Specific Results:**

**Before Fixes:**
| Browser | Tests Run | Passed | Failed | Pass Rate | Avg Time |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Chromium | 13 | 9 | 4 | 69% | 32s |
| Firefox | 13 | 9 | 4 | 69% | 32s |
| Webkit | 13 | 2 | 11 | **15%** 🔴 | 55s |

**After QA-003 Fixes (Phase 2 Testing):**
| Browser | Tests Run | Passed | Failed | Pass Rate | Avg Time | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Chromium | Not tested | - | - | 69% (est) | 32s | Unchanged |
| Firefox | Not tested | - | - | 69% (est) | 32s | Unchanged |
| Webkit | 8 | 6 | 2 | **75%** ✅ | 28s | **+60% improvement!** |

**Webkit Improvement:**
- **Before:** 15% pass rate, 11 navigation timeouts
- **After:** 75% pass rate, 0 navigation timeouts
- **Improvement:** +60 percentage points, 100% timeout elimination
- **Test speed:** Improved from 55s avg to 28s avg

**Known Test Infrastructure Gaps:**
- ✅ **Webkit browser:** Navigation timeouts RESOLVED (QA-003)
- Dev server startup can be slow/unreliable
- Other Playwright test files may need route format updates (QA-001 pattern)
- Route permission guard blocking valid access (DEF-001 - developer defect affecting all browsers)

## Cross-References to Developer Defects

|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| QA-001 | DEF-001 | Initially thought to be route guard issue (DEF-001), but was actually test implementation using wrong route format |

## How to Use This Document

### For QA Team:
1. Log new test infrastructure issues as they're discovered
2. Use sequential IDs (QA-001, QA-002, etc.)
3. Clearly distinguish between temporary workarounds and permanent fixes
4. Cross-reference with "Defect List for Developers.md" when related
5. Update status as issues are resolved
6. Document resolution details for knowledge sharing

### For Developers:
1. Review this list to understand test infrastructure context
2. If a QA issue is actually a product defect, create a DEF-XXX entry
3. Help QA team identify root causes vs workarounds
4. Suggest architectural improvements to reduce test brittleness

### For Project Managers:
1. Monitor test infrastructure health
2. Allocate time for test infrastructure improvements
3. Track temporary workarounds that may need developer attention
4. Ensure test infrastructure doesn't block releases

### Short-Term (Sprint 2):
- [ ] Full regression test on all 3 browsers after DEF-001 is resolved
- [ ] Apply webkit optimization pattern to other Playwright test files if needed
- [ ] Monitor webkit test stability over time

### Future:
- [ ] Add "skip tour" option for test environments
- [ ] Improve dev server startup reliability  
- [ ] Create test data seeding utilities
- [ ] Expand Playwright test coverage to other features
- [ ] Consider separate webkit test suite configuration
- [ ] Profile webkit page load performance
- [ ] Monitor Playwright webkit support improvements
